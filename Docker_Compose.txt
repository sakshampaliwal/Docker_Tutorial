Docker Compose:
- Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
- let's assume you were assigned on a project which requires at least 10 different services in a running state to run your project so it
  will be very tedious to run docker run command again and again for 10 services, this is where docker compose comes in.
- It allows you to define a complex application stack with multiple services, networks, and volumes in a single configuration file, making it easier to manage and deploy such applications. 

Docker Compose file components:
1. Services
2. Networks
3. Volumes
4. Environment Variables
5. Ports

Commands:
To start: docker-compose up
To Stop: docker-compose down  //container will be stopped and destroyed
Status of Containers: docker-compose ps
View Logs: docker-compose logs
Stop Container defined in yml file: docker-compose stop
Restart container that are already running: docker-compose restart
Start Service in detach mode: docker-compose up -d


If you docker-compose file is in diff folder: docker compose -f /path/to/heimdall.yml up -d
